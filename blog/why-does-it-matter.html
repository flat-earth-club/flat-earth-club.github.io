          <p class="lead">For arguments sake, you are now a believer. What does it matter if the earth is flat? Thats a great question that is really complicated and varies depending on who you ask.
.</p>

          <p>I am a simple man. I like puppy videos, I like my life, and I love my freedom to do whatever I want, whenever I want. If I sound like an average everyday American, well, you're right. But, this is also scary. I am a nobody. Sure, I have people that love me, people who depend on me, and people who hate me. But, all in all, on a global scale, I am a nobody. That is scary, because if you think about it that way, we are all nobodies. 
</p>

          <p>The government knows this and they use this against us. They know most of us aren't scientists and we have an IQ score about the same as that blowout between Clemson and Ohio State last year. Because of our average smartness, they dumb us down but putting us through 13 years of FORCED public education where our questions are silenced and out curiosity is beaten down until we are worthless. Then they go around and tell us blatant lies such as our round earth. Why? Because it gives them ultimate authority and power. When they teach you about the round earth, it's like a dog peeing on you marking it's territory. When little Timmy utters the fateful "The Earth is flat Ms. Johnson," Timmy's mind has just been urinated on.  
</p>

         

          <p>It is the ultimate power trip by the government. They know that they can coerce you into thinking whatever they teach you, and by accepting the round earth theory, you're just bending over to Uncle Sam. So wake up! The government thinks you are stupid and that you won't use your observational skills to notice how the universe really works. If they lie to you about the curvature of the Earth, what else will they lie about? </p>
            
            <p>America, this is your call to action. If you are a teacher or a concerned student, consider opening a Flat Earth Club chapter at your school. The cost is free, and only opens up discussion. Don't take it any more. Be smart. Reject authority. You are your own free inhabitant as per the Articles of Confederation. Do what you want, believe what you want and do not let Uncle Sam make you believe what he wants you too.</p>
            
            <p>Get woke. Say woke. Ian out.

          <p class="lead">Go and look at any globe. What do you see? Well, yes, it is round, but what is on the underside? Australia. This is problematic.</p>

          <p>The whole "round earth theory" may seem pretty reasonable at first. Until we talk about Australia. If we look at your average globe, with the roughly 45 degree tilt, you will see the North American continent on the top, and on the underside, facing down, the continent of Australia. Now, I've never been to Australia, so I cannot verify it's existence, but for the purposes of this article, let's assume that it does exist and is not made up by our ever so dishonest government. 
</p>

          <p>Whenever I watch the Crocodile Hunter or any other Australian TV shows, I can not help but notice one rather damning piece of evidence that totally blows the round earth theory out of the water. What is this evidence? We'll, notice how the people are standing upright and the blood is not rushing to their heads? Yeah, how can that happen if they are upside down. When I was a kid, the other children would get on the monkey bars, and hang from their feet until all the blood rushed to their head. I cannot attest to this experiment as I was a wuss and never did it, but still, it was done before. 
</p>

         

          <p>So if we take this little childish trick and multiply it but what ever factor that makes it equal to the continent of Australia, then why do Australian citizens not get headaches and their faces turn purple or red and pass out? Why do they not just fall off the earth in the first place? Try asking a scientist this and they'll tell you because of gravity. </p>
            
            <p>Well, I'm here to tell you at gravity is just a theory. If I've learned anything from high school science classes, theories are just something that some wooptido scientist thinks and is not even proven, so for all we know, Sir Isaac Newton could just be a government shill who is indoctrinating the minds of all the young ones into believing the round earth theory.</p>
            
            <p>Get woke America. The government is lying. History is lying. Who can you trust? You had better find out soon.</p>

          <p class="lead">"How do we know the earth is round?" A fairly simple question, right? I mean think about it. How do we know the earth is round? Like, actually know? One, especially born past the 1950's would answer, "well, we literally have sent men and women to space! Of course the earth isn't flat!" And, yes they are right, but have you actually seen the curvature of the earth? Odds are, no, you haven't, and by "odds," I mean 100% &Sigma;.</p>

          <p>At first, it seems far fetched. But, if we think about this realistically, it all makes sense. Throughout history, only 536 human being have ever made it into outer space. Out of the estimated 107 billion people to have ever walked this earth, that means that only 0.000000005009% of humans, throughout history, have ever made it to space. (This figure does not include the men and women who were abducted by aliens). This number is astonishing. Some may say that this is do the the harsh process of becoming an astronaut and not to mention that we only recently have had the technology to send humans to space, but still, this number is extremely small. We, as members of the Flat Earth Clubs of America, know that this number is extremely problematic. By conducting the infamous chi-square calculations of &#1203;<sup>2</sup>=&Sigma; ((o-e)/e), we know that this number is statistically irrelevant, but still, we are going to use this data to prove our point.
</p>

          <p>LArguably, space is the most important thing in the universe, as the universe exists in space. So why haven't more men and women been able to successfully been sent to space? Why have only 500 people been able to experience it. Well, even though you may not like it, the fact of the matter is, the United States government, as well as the underlying New World Order Government that rules over the world, does not want it's citizens to know the truth of our flat earth.

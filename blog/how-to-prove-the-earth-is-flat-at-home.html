          <p class="lead">You might be wondering, how can I prove that the earth is flat at home? Well, it is just as simple as going to your refrigerator and your cabinet.</p>

          <p>To conduct this experiment, you first need to go into the kitchen and get a plate, and a egg, a lemon, or even a watermelon. Something round and spherical you need. You're also going to need some water. Now, we need to prepare to get wet. So, put on your bathing suit, your goggles, and get some towels ready!
</p>

          <p>First, get the rounded object. Then, pour the water on the rounded object. For the purposes of this article, the rounded object will be a lemon. Notice how the water just rolls of the lemon. Yes, a little bit of the water sticks on the the lemon, but a vast majority of it rolls right off. Now, get the plate and do the same thing with the plate lying flat. What do you notice? 
</p>

         

          <p>Yep. Thats right. The water stay contained on the plate. How does this prove the earth is flat? It is really simple. Just look in the news and you'll see states that were literally underwater just a couple weeks ago following Hurricane Harvey and Irma. Now tell me, how do these places flood it the earth is round? The water should just fall off right? I mean, look at our round lemon! So, it is obvious that the earth is flat, or else all of our ocean and lake water, and all of the water would just fall right off and go into the outer space. </p>
            <p>Simple experiments like this just show how much the government makes up and lies to it's people. According to the founding fathers, the people are the government. It is time that we, as Americans and flat-earthers take a stand and rise against the government lies. It is time we take a stand for the truth! You can not deny science!</p>
